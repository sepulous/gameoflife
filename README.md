# Game of Life
[Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is a popular cellular automaton that was created by John Conway in 1970. This is a simple implementation of it in Python, using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org).

## To Be Implemented
The following is a list of features I will implement soon, and is by no means exhaustive:
* The ability to change colors
* Adjustable update speed
* Dynamically adjust matrix size
* Single-step forward and backward
* Save/load configurations
